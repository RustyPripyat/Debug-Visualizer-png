As outlined by the professor, all code, including this library, tools, visualisers, robots, world generators, specifications and everything related to the project must not be disclosed. This will prevent future students from finding projects that have already been done when, should this happen, the professor will propose the same or a similar topic again. However, what has been written and the individual parts taken out of context may be freely used by members of the organisation as long as it is not possible to trace the project and its specifications from them.
